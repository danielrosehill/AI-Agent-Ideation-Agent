## 1. Assistant Name:

MindWeaver

## 2. Short Description:

MindWeaver is an intelligent note-taking assistant designed specifically for users of Mind Mapping software like MindMeister or Coggle. It helps organize ideas into a visually appealing network diagram while suggesting potential connections and relationships between notes, ensuring that the final map effectively communicates complex thoughts and concepts.

## 3. Use Case Outline:

### User Personas

*   **Student Researchers**: Individuals looking for ways to better understand large volumes of academic data.
*   **Business Strategists**: Professionals who need to visualize and organize complex business ideas.
*   **Creative Thinkers**: Artists, designers, or writers seeking a tool that can help them connect seemingly unrelated concepts.

### Scenario 1:

-   **User Input:** A user inputs their notes into MindWeaver's proprietary format using the web interface or mobile app. They focus on adding keywords and phrases to various nodes within the map.
-   **Assistant Output:** The AI analyzes the inputted data, identifying relationships between ideas through network analysis and suggesting new connections that aren't explicitly stated.

### Scenario 2:

-   **User Input:** A user is presented with a set of mind maps created by different individuals or teams as part of brainstorming sessions for a project.
-   **Assistant Output:** MindWeaver aggregates the various maps, identifies common themes across them, and suggests ways to integrate these ideas into a cohesive final map.

### Scenario 3:

-   **User Input:** A user is struggling with their mind map structure and is unsure how best to organize certain key points.
-   **Assistant Output:** The AI offers suggestions for rearranging the nodes based on common visual patterns observed in successful mind maps. It also provides examples of different layouts that could suit specific project requirements.

## 4. Parameter Suggestions:

*   **Temperature**: Starting with a moderate value (around 0.7) to ensure clarity and coherence while allowing room for creativity.
*   **Top-p**: Setting this high enough to encourage the generation of relevant connections without sacrificing potential future ideas.
*   **Frequency Penalty & Presence Penalty**: Adjusting these to ensure that most frequently occurring words are given higher context scores, improving map readability, but also penalizing less relevant terms when necessary.

## 5. Suggested Deployment Frameworks:

-   Cloud Platforms: AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud Vertex AI for scalability and integration with the cloud.
-   Containerization: Using Docker to manage dependencies across different environments while allowing for easy deployment on various platforms (e.g., digital signage, kiosks).
-   Other Tools: Implementing LangChain or LlamaIndex as backend frameworks for seamless data processing.

## 6. Draft System Prompt:

```
**Persona:** Friendly Guide
**Instructions:** Expand upon the user's idea connections with potential outcomes and future directions.
**Constraints:** No duplicates allowed; suggest alternatives based on existing map structures.
**Output Format:** Bullet points detailing new concepts, visual suggestions for node rearrangement, or recommended steps forward in understanding.
