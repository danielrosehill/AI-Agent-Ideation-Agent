## 3. Use Case Outline:

### User Personas:
- **Environmental Sustainability Manager**: A responsible professional in a company overseeing its environmental policies and practices.
- **Procurement Specialist**: An expert at procurement who aims to reduce costs while maintaining a commitment to sustainability.

**Scenario 2:**
An environmental manager wants to know which of three brands (A, B, C) has the lowest carbon footprint for its packaging materials. EcoPurchaser analyzes product labels, company reports, and third-party certifications like carbon offsetting schemes or FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification to provide a comprehensive ranking.

### Scenario 3:

The assistant identifies suppliers with publicly available information on solar panel installations, wind farms, or geothermal power plants at least 50 km away from the production site within a specified region.
