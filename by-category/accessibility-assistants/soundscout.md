## 1. Assistant Name:

SoundScout

## 2. Short Description:

SoundScout is an accessible audio assistance platform designed specifically for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in various settings, including workplaces, schools, and public spaces.

SoundScout aims to bridge the auditory gap by providing real-time captioning, translations, and descriptions for auditory inputs such as meetings, lectures, presentations, and everyday conversations. By doing so, it enhances communication accessibility and fosters inclusivity in all environments.

## 3. Use Case Outline:

### User Personas:
- The target user is a deaf or hard of hearing individual who attends public events or participates in workplace discussions.
- Their goals are to effectively communicate with others without feeling left out due to lack of auditory access.

### Scenario 1: Attending a Meeting

User inputs: Attend an upcoming company meeting where there's no prior notice that audio interpretation will be provided. They want real-time captions for any presentations, discussions, or announcements made during the event.

- Expected assistant output: Real-time video-based captioning on their personal device via SoundScout app.
- User benefits: Clear understanding of all meeting materials and events without relying on sign language interpreters.
- Technical requirements: The user's device should have internet connectivity (preferably a 4G or better network) for real-time data transfer.

### Scenario 2: Engaging in Workplace Discussions

User inputs: Participate in everyday conversations among colleagues during lunch hours. They wish to receive audio descriptions of their surroundings, such as the names of food items on a menu or announcements about meetings.

- Expected assistant output: Audio description of their environment in real-time through SoundScout's wearable device.
- User benefits: Enhanced navigation and communication skills without relying on visual cues only available when they're not wearing the device.
- Technical requirements: Wearable headphones with internet connectivity for receiving audio descriptions.

### Scenario 3: Exploring Public Spaces

User inputs: Visit a museum or historical landmark. They want to understand spoken information about exhibits, artifacts, and artworks through translations and descriptions.

- Expected assistant output: Translations of exhibit labels, guided tours in various languages, and descriptive narratives for visually impaired users.
- User benefits: Full access to cultural knowledge without barriers related to language or visual comprehension challenges.
- Technical requirements: Device should be connected to Wi-Fi for real-time translation service activation upon entry into each exhibit area.

## 4. Suggested Tools:

*   APIs:
    *   Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
    *   Microsoft Azure Speech Services API
*   MCP Tools:
    *   Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for infrastructure and data processing needs.
    *   Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for efficient data storage and retrieval.
*   Libraries/Frameworks:
    *   TensorFlow.js, PyTorch.js for developing machine learning models in the browser.
    *   React Native for cross-platform application development.

## 5. Draft System Prompt:

```
"Assist a deaf user attending an office meeting. Provide video-based real-time captions of any presentations or announcements and offer suggestions to enhance communication."

The system prompt should instruct SoundScout to continuously monitor the audio environment, recognize spoken words in key phrases (e.g., names of people presenting), and then translate those recognized elements into written form for the user’s viewing on their wearable device. It also needs guidance that includes:
 
- Identifying relevant speakers at any given moment during a presentation
- Automatically transcribing the main ideas presented by these speakers

```

## 6. Parameter Suggestions:

*   Temperature: A value slightly above 0 to balance between fluency and readability, e.g., 1.
*   Top-p: A moderate value (e.g., .5) that balances precision with overall coherence and engaging prose.
*   Frequency Penalty: Adjust this based on context sensitivity or task demand—this parameter controls how strongly generated text is discouraged from repeating itself in similar ways across many iterations.

The goal of SoundScout isn’t just about providing real-time captions but creating a seamless experience where deaf users don't have to rely on additional support or external resources for everyday interactions. By leveraging advancements in AI, machine learning, and wearable technology, it offers an accessible platform that empowers full participation and inclusion in public spaces, workplaces, and educational environments alike.
